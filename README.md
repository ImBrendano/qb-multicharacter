# qb-multicharacter
qb-multicharacter design updated for newest qbcore (Date of update: 01.27.2025)

I hate red and the register inputs and buttons were way off, 
so I spent a few hours making it blue and fixing all the scaling / display ratio issues with the character register form.


INSTALL

delete original qb-multicharacter and replace with this. (make sure your folder is named "qb-multicharacter")
designed by marcostom32 and updated by itsbrendan#5279
You can change the banner image by replacing qb-pixel.png with a png with the same name.
